## Week 52
I’m still telling people I haven’t been here a year, yet it is the pointy end and on Monday it will be a year. Did I make the right choice? Definitely. Do I miss friends and family? Definitely. Am I still Australian? Definitely. France had a public holiday this week as did Brisbane. France celebrated the ascent of Mary to heaven (also marking the end of the long summer holidays), and Brisbane took time out for Exhibition show day. France is attempting to remove a few public holidays – this is not one of them.

The heat remains horrible with nearby regions clocking hottest temperatures for 20 years. I’m envious of Australian temperatures knowing I’ll be feeling the reverse in five months. I could see smoke on very distant mountains as fires blazed out of control in the southeast... many lit by the same arsonist, who was arrested after his car was identified.

I’ve delivered bags of plums and figs to the closest neighbours… there’s still lots of bad feeling due to the serious noise being made by my builders – one person has threatened to get the police involved. While I was delivering the fruit an elderly couple mentioned that in 10 years they hadn’t really got to know their neighbours. I suggested they need to make some very loud noise!

Féria is an annual Béziers festival (Aug 13-17) swelling our population from 80,000 to 2 million during five days. I was cautious however, headed into town and found it incredible. Lots of family events, street activity, food, loud music. I met some people to see a show that didn’t start until 10:30pm. Also watched a bullfight which was horrible – I left after the first act… didn’t need to see beautiful beasts killed for fun.

Over 20kgs of plums given to neighbours...

I bought a red bandana to fit in!

I needed to see... don't need to see again.
