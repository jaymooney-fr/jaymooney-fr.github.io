## Week 43
I’m feeling very French for using oui, oui, oui, oui, oui when answering in the affirmative to a question. Mark Twain humorously said that “the French always tangle up everything to that degree, when you start into a sentence you never know whether you are going to get out alive or not”.

Water company is replacing meter boxes along the whole street and their truck was across my driveway when the bathrooms arrived. I asked for temporary access and the young contractor asked “English?” and I responded “Australian”. Australia! I love Australia… RUGBY – I play rugby. Struggling with a bathtub and stone shower bases that were heavier than I could lift alone, two of the contractors offered to carry them into the house for me 🤩

The deepest shipwreck in French waters, a 16th-century merchant ship was discovered earlier this year 2,567 metres below the surface in the Mediterranean. And totally unrelated, I’ve used almost 12 months of Audible credits on the Gamache series by Louise Penny – some available free from the library.

No looting at this depth, but there is modern day rubbish amongst the history.

Back road home from the beach avoiding the toll highway.
