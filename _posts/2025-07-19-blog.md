## Week 48
Had some wins this week. Received a cheque and went to a bank to brave their ATM. I needed a card for the account which I don‚Äôt have‚Ä¶ lady at reception wrote out a deposit slip, gave me a copy, smiled and took the cheque. All without an appointment. Also went to the paint shop after sending an email requesting gloss for doors and jambs and being told I‚Äôd need to come in, pay and wait for the order to be processed at their main factory. In the shop I clarified to a member of staff what I needed, he mixed three litres on the spot for less than the previous quote, then gave me 10% off because‚Ä¶ maybe I looked nervous ‚Ä¢ which I was!

Stacked my car with rubbish and drove to the tip ‚Äì finding it closed at 12 on a Saturday. Thankfully open again 9:00am on Sunday. At just the right time I‚Äôve been given some large plastic pots which, lined with garbage bags are perfect to easily take rubble to the tip (d√©chetterie in French). Lots of rubble right now as I‚Äôm removing floor tiles. The masonry drill and I are working as one, until one of us breaks down üòÅ Hopefully the drill as it‚Äôs still under warranty.

Killing a snake in France is illegal and those who do kill a snake risk a fine or prison. This is because snakes are considered to play a vital role in local ecosystems. It is forbidden to burn green waste at home due to toxic fumes. And all around B√©ziers recyclable bins are joined by an underground vacuum system that shoots rubbish straight through to collection centres.
