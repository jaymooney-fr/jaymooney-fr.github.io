## Week 50
Crazy work this week removing tiles from the upstairs bathroom. Tiles have been laid on top of tiles… no harder to remove however double the rubble. Somebody mentioned that the number of tip visits is limited – thankfully I haven’t been turned away. Great news is the builder is threatening to start work this Monday • so fingers crossed. There was a hiccup with council approving the deck which has been sorted, so I’m hoping it’s full steam ahead!

In amongst pulling up tiles, I visited an English couple who live 50 mins north. We headed into the nearby village Olargues for dinner, live music and dancing (not us) at an outdoor food market – held weekly during summer. Also had the opportunity to have dinner with a choir member at a local Béziers restaurant… possibly need to revisit a budget sometime not too soon!

Ever since I’ve been here I’ve kept a lookout for a French book I love (I read the English translation a long time ago). “The Elegance of the Hedgehog” is now being read in French and due for completion Dec 2027. It’s the little things 🤩

At this stage I was truly over the bathroom... tiles all gone now.
