## Week 6

Some differences that are not significant but funny are that end crusts are removed from all loaves of bread. Wine bottles are still corked. Alcohol is very cheap... I think it's not taxed. Painting rollers and trays are only 20cm wide unless you're a professional and then you can buy 30cm wide but not from the local Bunnings equivalent. Bus stops are part of the road and hold up traffic on all stops. Two stroke motorbikes are very prominent as are cyclists – no one seems to mind slowing down when they can't pass.

They have tiger mozzies here. Small, skilful little kamikaze bastards from Africa that are impossible to swat. They bite through clothes and leave welts remaining itchy for weeks. And of course they can carry dengue and zika. Have bought spray containing DEET! Annoying thing is that I left Bushman repellent back in Australia thinking there would be no mosquitoes here.

House contract has been signed by the sellers so I'm a bit excited that it will go ahead however it's not guaranteed until solicitors have done their work. Car was disappointingly not the one I test drove, so I've negotiated a change. Will be the same model but a different spec and with better satnav. Registration and insurance still needs to be changed but hoping to pickup Monday.
