## Y2 â€¢ Week 4
The three aussie guests arrived today â€¢ theyâ€™re foodies, lots of fun and Iâ€™m looking forward to having a break away from the construction site. A great upside to visitors arriving was the urgency in finishing toilet, bath/shower and vanity. Getting out of the bath is not an elegant exercise but it is truly nice having hot water upstairs again, just as the weather cools ðŸ¤©

Walking through city streets with new touristsâ€™ eyes is always beautiful. Every time different things are seen as we venture up and down undiscovered streetsâ€¦ and itâ€™s very quiet as summer vacations are finished and during the off season, small boutiques and cafes close.

Everything is placed temporarily until plasterboard, tiles and flooring in place.
