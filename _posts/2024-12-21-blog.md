## Week 18

Took a few days for water to be connected and last night for the first time, I slept in my own home. Gas was sorted today and thankfully I now have warmth and hot water and I’m very content. Wifi being connected Monday so I can stop hotspotting my mobile and that's everything!

My bus card needs topping up and on a trip from the city today it didn’t work. I had given a beggar my last euro coin for his fare, and had to ask for it back to pay my own way. The bus driver let him on so I'm sure he’s regular.

I went on a walking tour around Béziers this week incorporating history and food. The young French guide spoke Spanish and English and makes me even more determined to become fluent. I’ve bought a coffee machine and some espresso glasses – how very French!

Water connection not just a phone call.
