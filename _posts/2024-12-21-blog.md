##Week 18
Took a few days for water to be connected and last night for the first time, I slept in my own home. Gas was sorted today and thankfully I now have warmth and hot water and I’m very content.

My bus card needs topping up and on a trip from the city today it didn’t work. I had given a beggar my last euro coin for his fare, and had to ask for it back to pay my own way. The bus driver let him on so he’s regular.

Water connection wasn't just a phone call.
