## Y2 • Week 2
I’ve been given a bicycle (white with pink stickers). Throughout the year I’ve bought from Aldi a helmet, lock and soft seat toying with the idea but procrastinating on buying – so tyres are now pumped, brakes adjusted… and still haven’t taken it out for a road test – will be wobbly for sure!

I picked the right profession teaching IT… this week I took out an internal preset concrete fire shaft with my trusty lump hammer. 7cm solid it took two days that totally knackered me. The higher up chimney stack is now sitting on “space” which I need to address – the good news is that I’m feeling stronger than ever and tuckshop arms are a thing of the past 🤩 Oh for a database to keep the brain challenged.

Bought fertiliser and poison for the garden and footpath. Sprayed weeds out the front which continue growing in good health… I’m thinking “lost in translation” but not prepared to spray more until certain. No noise complaints for three days so the heart rate is almost back to normal.
