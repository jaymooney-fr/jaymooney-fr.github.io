## Week 20
Funny fact 1: in May of every year French farmers around the country polish their tractors ahead of a trip to the local priest, hoping that the blessing will help bring good fortune. Funny fact 2: statistically more people die in France on Jan 3 than on any other single day – a phenomenon that has been happening for the past 20 years. I only found this out on Jan 4 so will be more careful next year.

Flicking through the local supermarket catalogue I was attracted to lamb from Australia on special so I’ve stocked up and invited neighbours from the adjoining 10 homes in for an Australia Day barbecue. And just because we haven’t eaten enough during Christmas and New Year, January 6 is a date celebrating Cake of the King… historically significant, but like Christmas the cake is more important.

In the invite to neighbours I mentioned I’d be making some noise renovating. A gentleman messaged me which Google translated to, he is behind me… not sure if he’s offering support or he lives in the house directly behind me.

Within 10 mins walk from home… Roundabouts are absolutely everywhere, might have mentioned this before.

Bountiful and still inedible.

Béziers – not a painting this time.
