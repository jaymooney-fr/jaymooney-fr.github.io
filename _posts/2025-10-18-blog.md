## Y2 ‚Ä¢ Week 9
Before coming over I joined a language meetup group to learn some basics. At the caf√© I met a lady who was doing her masters in French history 1000 to 1300AD. She had a cute dog but I pegged her as an eccentric ‚Ä¢ OMG I get it now‚Ä¶ locally 1209 was exceptional for all the wrong reasons and Joan of Arc didn‚Äôt make an appearance until 1400.

Caught the wrong bus twice this week‚Ä¶ new timetable with different end points confused me and I ended up in parts of B√©ziers never seen before! Understand the names now for end points taking me into the city, and which one gets me home ‚Äì 11 stops and less than 20 minutes. I'm very lucky as many routes and stops have merged or disappeared but the stop 50 metres from my front gate remains.

Following somebody else I picked a prickly pear to eat being careful to dodge the cactus prickles. Too late I realised the pear had tiny prickles that instantly became embedded in fingers and tongue. Very watery, sweetish, beetroot in colour ‚Äì and not racing out to try again ü§©

How did I get to 61 and not tasted this? They sell them at the markets, prickles removed!

Saw a sign for an astronomy photography exhibition in a tiny church out in the sticks. This is the constellation my street is named after. How does it go... when you like something you take ownership ‚Äì my doctor, dentist, accountant üòÅ
