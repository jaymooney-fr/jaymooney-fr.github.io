## Week 30
This week I caught the ferry from mainland France to Corsica with an Australian visitor and a random French friend. 11 hours overnight with little sleep due to noise and reclining chairs that didn't quite recline enough. We’ve had a few big days driving and the varying landscape from mountains to sea has been beautiful. Drove from where we are staying in an Airbnb situated south west to Bastia in the north east today – 200km each way on winding roads. Then had the Airbnb owners in to help celebrate my birthday with pizza and champagne. Between their French and limited English and our English and limited French we all got our stories understood.
