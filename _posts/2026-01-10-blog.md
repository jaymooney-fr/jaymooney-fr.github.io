## Y2 • Week 21
Aussie tourist having a real adventure holiday staying with me, is sadly returning home next week. Together we’ve rendered, painted and visited hardware shops – and of course beautiful villages. There was a moment of trepidation about the paint I purchased a year ago as I couldn’t really remember its exact colour. Turns out it’s PANTONE colour of the year 2026! Tiniest amount of grey – only one person has said they thought it was white and I’ve buried them.

Found the following info on an Occitanie website: With almost 300 castles to visit, it is like a kingdom filled with heroic figures, military architecture, winding corridors and countless towers 😍 reasons why I’m loving living here.

Visited two restaurants and was shouted lunch at both this week (food photos below)– not complaining but my first two layers are feeling a little tight. Top layers are fine ~ both jackets! 😯

Dessert was delicious – and I was about to explode after an entree and two mains!!
