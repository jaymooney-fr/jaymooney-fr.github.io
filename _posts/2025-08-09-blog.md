## Week 51
Bit alert that my new visa has not been approvedâ€¦ a very similar situation to the weeks leading up to leaving Australia. Iâ€™ve heard that buying a house here pretty much ensures all will be ok â€“ maybe keep your sofa available! Builders have been phenomenal and very noisy. Iâ€™ve pissed off many neighbours, who are now leaving hate mail in the letterbox. Two or three days next week and the continuous jackhammering of walls will be finished. Iâ€™ve letterboxed 30 neighbours letting them know this, and a few have let me know they understand. And a few have let me know their skills and availability for plumbing, electrical etc.ðŸ¤©

A neighbourhood cat lies waiting for birds in the garden, and sets off the motion sensor during the night as I leave one door slightly ajarâ€¦ itâ€™s cute in the morning to see paw prints in the dust. In the garden plums and figs are almost ripeâ€¦ which Iâ€™ll distribute to the angry neighbours ðŸ¤£

The builder invited me out as a client for dinnerâ€¦ nothing romantic as he is married, has many teeth missing and knows everything! I did offer to grab him a toothpick which he declined. Buffet on steroids â€“ mix of Thai, Chinese and Japaneseâ€¦ steak and seafood cooked as you order and walking distance from home.

I have water and food... and the dust has made my hair like hay!
