## Week 28
Letterboxes in France are large empty cubes that are set into our fences. They are opened with a master key by courier and postal services from the street. It’s taken until just recently to realise that they are not trespassing and placing packages from the unlocked, house side of the fence.

Two big trips this week, one north and one south. The tourism office provided an excellent map showing France’s most beautiful villages, Unesco and other historic sites, museums and more. It’s easy to set off, plugging in a site or an address and leaving the satnav to do all the hard work. Trip north included a guided tour of the Roquefort Cheese Caves, and the trip south included a ride on a little yellow train through part of the Pyrenees. Three of us hopped off at the highest station with our baguettes and coffee flasks, found a picnic table and ate with light snow landing on us.

In Béziers there is an enchanted trail containing Greek gods and goddesses carved from marble. An easy walk, the guided path is nestled in amongst holm oaks and ash trees.

One of four floors... the King of cheeses according to those who know.

On the trip two 10 year old girls heard us speaking and asked me questions in english while I answered in French. "What's my favourite colour?" and "what's my favourite movie?" – they were very cute.
