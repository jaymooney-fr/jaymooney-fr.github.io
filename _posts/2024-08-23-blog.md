## Week 1
Everything depended on receiving a Long Stay Visa... arrived six days before leaving, giving me the time for final farewells and time to sell the car.</p>
Flew Emirates. Nothing can prepare you for the long haul 14 hours to Dubai followed by 7 hours to Nice. Then 6 hours on the fast train to Beziers. Met an Aussie couple in Dubai buying property in Italy so we swapped details to share our journeys.

Staying in an AirBnb until the end of August and then moving into a rental in Serignan 10kms away. This will be my base while looking for a place to buy. Returning to Beziers was beautiful ‚Äì walking streets I'd walked before on the trip earlier this year. I'm five flights up and looking out the window, a pair of pigeons are nesting on a sill opposite looking after their chicks... new beginnings for all of us!!

Firetruck got stuck downstairs on my corner... and the next one.
