## Week 1
Everything depended on receiving a Long Stay Visa before leaving... arrived six days before leaving, giving me the time for a final farewell and to sell the car.</p>
Flew Emirites. Nothing can prepare you for the long haul 14 hours to Dubai followed by 7 hours to Nice. Then 6 hours on the fast train to Beziers. Met a couple in Dubai buying property in Italy so we swapped details to share our journeys.</p>
Staying in an AirBnb until the end of August and then moving into a rental in Serignan 10kms away. This will be my base while looking for a place to buy. Returning to Beziers was beautiful - walking streets I'd walked before on the trip earlier this year. I'm five flights up and looking out the window a pair of pigeons are nesting on a window sill opposite, looking after their new chicks... new beginnings for all of us!!</p>
