## Y2 • Week 16
Heading off to sleep earlier this week I heard a noise downstairs. Waited 10-15 minutes then wandered down to find an inch of water on the floor and a water pipe parted – my doing for not pushing two ends together enough when clamping. Problem quickly solved and an important lesson learnt. A few days later I received a letter from Suez (water provider) advising they noticed a spike in usage and I may have a leak… happy to have it fixed.

Vising new sites and old with two Aussies I went to school with this week. Revisited Gorges d'Héric (a favourite) and afterwards stopped for lunch with friends. Not tired of revisiting sites and never tired of showing off my little part of the world. 🤩 Fireplace is in full swing and slow cooked meals are keeping us warm.

I’ve collated a whole heap of paperwork and sending to a translator on Monday to then present to the powers that be for a visa. Still completely out of my control so I’m keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for the best 😁

Church in Béziers not visited before. A few minutes walk from the city centre – beautiful stained glass windows and a great view.
