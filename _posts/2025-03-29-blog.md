## Week 32
Trekked out and about to Nîmes on Wednesday taking the back roads through Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert – a truly beautiful medieval village. Fun fact: De Nîmes translates to “from Nîmes” and it’s where denim was originally produced. Occupied by Romans at some point, the remains of an impressive aqueduct and an amphitheatre (smaller version of the colosseum in Rome) are still standing – both Unesco sites.

Having coffee on Friday, a Mallard duck landed and walked around our feet – a regular for sure because people threw him food and chatted to him. The dogs became very excited, while somebody asked whether kangaroos walked through our cafes in Australia…

Came across a church door recently that required an entry fee of two euros. On inserting the coin into a slot, the whole interior lit up. While walking around, I silently checked that I had another coin to get us out if needed.

Daylight savings starts in France tomorrow putting our time forward an hour • I think 🤩
