## Y2 • Week 15
Found another all you can eat Chinese buffet this week… crazy variety of food beautifully presented – don’t need to eat again until Tuesday!! And I’ve learned that scrunching up alfoil and rubbing it over tapware brings them up like new – it’s the little things 😁

Floor needs to be laid before kitchen arriving, giving me a deadline to finish a few things which is a good thing. I’ve been very relaxed renovating which has caused its own problem with a lack of motivation. Some days the tasks seem too big, so it’s good to have a goal again.

Heading out to buy firewood today… temperatures are getting lower – often less than 5° but with the wind it feels like -5°. I know it’s crazy hot in Queensland so this is not a complaint… just a chilly observation.

Mongrel metal door frames set into  cement took hours to remove... all gone now!

Painting on walls is a big thing here...

Also statues inset into walls is a big thing here...
