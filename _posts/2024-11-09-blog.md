## Week 12

My life is back on track… Aldi sells crunchy peanut paste and after a 10 day cooling off period, I’ve finally paid the deposit on 18 avenue de la pléiade Béziers. In astronomy Pleiades is a constellation, and from a mythological point of view is known as the seven sisters and obviously I have too much free time on my hands.

Drove 100km up to Millau during the week and dropped into the viaduct visitor centre. Satnav turned me into a street that I swear was a footpath… not more than a few inches clearance either side of my mirrors. No damage, however there were channels in the stonework where other cars hadn’t been so lucky.

Weather cooling here, I’m still in single layers but wearing socks to bed. We’ve had storms during the last few nights and clear sunny days. It’s strange experiencing thunder and lightning just like home. I hear Australia is warm, so I’ll stop now about how beautiful and cool it is!

Viaduc de Millau was the tallest when it opened in 2004.

Feels like Katoomba.

Just another street...

Visible by the naked eye on a clear night.
