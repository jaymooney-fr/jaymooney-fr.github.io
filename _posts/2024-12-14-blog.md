## Week 17

And just like that it happened. Solicitor emailed booking an appointment. I made a bank transfer, picked up the keys and the house is mine! Utilities not sorted so I haven’t stayed overnight, however removalists moved furniture, amazon purchases and boxes from Australia yesterday, and appliances are booked for delivery tomorrow.

Right in the centre of Béziers there is an area called the Place des bon amis (good friends square). It’s an historic site, of course.

I’ve joined “Out and about in Béziers” a fb group for local English speakers with varying levels of French. We met for Christmas lunch and I ended up on a table with five lovely lively funny women… it was good.
