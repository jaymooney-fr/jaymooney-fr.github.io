## Week 7

Drove past a nice Château when looking at a house in Maraussan (10 mins from Béziers). Googled it and set the satnav only to end up at the local pharmacy... in the right town and only five minutes away from the main attraction. The satnav and I haven't quite synched ourselves with escaping roundabouts, I'm still being trained and I'm sure there is an emphasis on the PLEASE do a uturn in 600 metres.

Popped over to check out the local airport (Beziers Cap d'Agde) www.beziers.aeroport.fr/en/ servicing Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, England, Scotland, Germany and Paris. 15 minutes from Beziers with a free shuttle service provided in the new car.

Trying to not get too excited about the house until it settles which is hard as there is an Aldi three minutes away. On the markdown table this week were paint brushes, buckets, shelves, mirrors, coffee tables, sponges, detergent, extension leads, coffee pots and toasters. And yes, I bought one or more of each!

Not sure I would let paint leak under masking tape... but here it is hanging in the local gallery of modern art.
