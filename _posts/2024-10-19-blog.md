## Week 9

I volunteered last weekend at the Beziers Urban Trail – a 9, 15 or 25 km run through places of significance often not open to the public. I was stationed at a nightclub (the gasworks) – open to the public but I was never going to see inside as it doesn't open until midnight. My role was to signal that people should turn left to enter a doorway.

In French it's common to say "to not be in one’s plate" meaning to feel under the weather or to not look like yourself. Powerpoints here don't have on|off switches, they are just on. I've bought travel adapters for all rooms in the new house (still not mine). Will do a special edition of the blog when it is mine... showing champagne flowing.

Painting has started in the home that I'm renting. Paint smells different but not in a bad way. It's a good excuse to leave the house and acquaint myself with the equavilent of Bunnings, Goodguys etc. Planning a trip to IKEA Montpellier this week. It's an hour away which is pretty much what it was in Brisbane.

Beziers Urban Trail participants running along the Canal du Midi. The Canal travels across a bridge over the river Orb. Top left corner is the Catedral de Saint-Nazaire – its beauty a major influence on me moving to Beziers.

Sunset from my bedroom window – the love affair continues.
