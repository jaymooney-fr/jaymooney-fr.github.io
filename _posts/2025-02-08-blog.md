## Week 25
BÃ©ziers is in the HÃ©rault region, known for its natural beauty and hiking tracks. Through the week a group of us headed out along the gorges d'heric â€“ an easy walk after an hourâ€™s drive along scenic winding roads through small villages. On the walk I chatted to an Australian my age, renovating her own home, born in Toowoombaâ€¦ and a total fruitcake ðŸ˜¯ fortunately not living nearby.

Continued chipping away on the studio this week. Rubbish removal is a real problem â€¢ there is a tip which Iâ€™m still not sure that Iâ€™m registered to use, so industrial sized garbage bags are accumulating in the front yard, which Iâ€™ve been told is a front garden or back garden (not a yard).

Passed a medical this week, a requirement for my first year Visa, and also needed for the next Visa application. Not sure of my steps had I failed the medicalâ€¦ some things itâ€™s not good to dwell on!

In a tiny village near the gorge is a house built in 1637. Empty and open to the weather it's a real renovators delight. The renovator would need deep pockets.

Within 10 mins walk from home... the hospital. Fortunately haven't needed to visit, comforting knowing it's there.
