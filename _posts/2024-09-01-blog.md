## Week 2
During the week I made the move from the AirBnb in Beziers to a rental in SÃ©rignan. I'm sharing a four bedroom home with a flatmate and renovations are due to start in October. I have a full kitchen again which is great and I've invited the neighbours in for dinner one night next week.

I've a system for people not understanding me, I translate on my phone and then say what I need to in French. When they don't understand me, I show them the phone. Works every time. My flatmate doesn't speak any English, so it's slow going... I feel I know lots of words but putting them into sentences remains challenging.

Weather has been really warm... heating is installed everywhere but no cooling. I spent ages in the local supermarket meat section, both for the cold and for the amazement at the high prices. Carrefour the supermarket is a mixture of Target and Woolworths including live seafood section.
