## Y2 • Week 24
Laying the floor took priority this week with kitchens delivered yesterday. Thinking I had this weekend to finish, it was until the wee hours I worked to the new deadline. Installation is booked for Monday and I didn’t realise delivery was earlier so I wrecked my body... every muscle hurt from wrists to toes. Turning over in bed or sitting on the loo caused agony and I was a little concerned I’d done damage, however an electric blanket solved everything. Very timely my street reopened after months of roadwork. I wasn’t sure the kitchens would be able to be delivered but it came together in the end. Nice being able to park my car in front of the house again – I’ve made two loads to the recycle station helping to ease out some of the aches 😁.

This week I was a party guest at La cabane exotique – African food and delicious and located in an unknown restaurant precinct. Then the night after went to a play in the Théâtre Municipal (mentioned in an earlier blog). Built in 1844 with an Italian-style auditorium it’s one of the few theatres in France of this era and style retaining its original aesthetic. Also Théatre des Variétés in Béziers reopened this week after renovations… still love living here 🤩.

Finished 1:30am – very quietly to not disturb the neighbours🤣.

Théâtre Municipal – I didn't understand too much of the dialog but the piano player was very good. Play was about an abandoned baby on a cruise liner who was raised by the crew and who became a famous pianist – never leaving the ship.

Street finished after taking this photo – it's perfect with the added advantage that the footpath was built up and I can drive through the gates... there was a step before 😀.
