## Y2 • Week 13
I'm concerned that my permanent residency application remains unapproved. It is showing on the official website as submitted and locals (French) are promising I have nothing to worry about 😊. During the wait, I’ve found a cream that cleared a long term and aggravating psoriasis itch in my ear canal, and that sitting slowly into a bathtub removes the tinnitus noise of a thousand cicadas for the evening – way too much info I know!

Road works start in my street next week restricting access to residents only for ten weeks. A bus stop four houses away has been removed which I’m hoping is temporary. Bifold doors are now in place and corrugated iron on the verandah will be completed next week. My mansplaining builder will then be finished. (Explaining something to a woman in a condescending, overconfident, and often inaccurate or oversimplified manner without regard to her own expertise).

French numbers start with the same pattern as in English… 1-10, 11-20, 21-30 etc until 70 when it becomes 60 plus 10, 11, 12… and then 80 which becomes 4 times 20 plus 1, 2, 3 and 90 which become 4 times 20 plus 10, 11, 12. Working towards understanding the cashier one day without looking at a digital display 😁

After coffee with a few locals every Friday, we all cross the road to a fresh produce market – passing by the statue of a resistance fighter immortalised for her own contribution and for the work with her brother. They are both Béziers heroes.

Holding onto my Australian roots!
