## Week 8

I have become a proud member of the "Fédération Photographique de France". Nothing to do with talent... more in line with handing over 20 euros. My press card gets me backstage to all sorts of gigs I'm promised.

Just once I'd like to go to the driver's side to get into the car... old habit, but heading to the passenger door is wearing pretty thin. The french keyboard is not the same as ours and I gave up trying to enter a password on a borrowed laptop.

Filled a baguette with cheese, bacon, pear, spinach leaf and cracked pepper... realising at the time that's why I'm here! In French it's common to say "he has a finger up his nose" which is equivalent to us saying he can do it with his eyes closed or with his hands behind his back.

This is a real art gallery... check out the windowsill.

On Google maps I saw a tourist icon for "Remarkable fig tree" and went looking. In the middle of a small vineyard is a plaque dedicated to the present owner's father who planted a seed at the end of Germany's occupation in 1944.

Visited Carcassonne during the week – just over an hour driving to see a historic site of real beauty. https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne
