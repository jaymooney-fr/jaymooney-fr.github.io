## Y2 • Week 5
OMG Avignon is beautiful… narrow streets with boutique shops and restaurants. Tourist season has finished and we walked up and down streets window shopping without crowds. It’s just short of two hours from Béziers but took longer as we stopped at Montpellier and Sète on the way for sightseeing. The AirBnb we’re staying at is within the walls of the old city, up lots of stairs, spacious and exquisitely furnished.

Ventured out to what’s marketed as “The most beautiful family business in the world”… Brun de Vian-Tiran (think merino and mohair) where a square pillow price was €288. Also stopped at Lacoste, an ancient village with a castle partly destroyed during the French Revolution. It’s had two notable owners: the scandalous Marquis de Sade (sadism and orgies) and Pierre Cardin (for good reasons).

Ran into a group of protesters playing stirring music and waving placards on the 18th – part of the strikes taking part all over France. Also hit a festival in Nimes where the satnav took us around streets a skinny horse would have shied away from. Couldn’t find a carpark so we came home.

Avignon is a walled city... built to protect the popes. Walked around the perimiter which is just over 4km.
