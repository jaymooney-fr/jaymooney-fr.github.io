## Y2 • Week 25
Celebrated Australia day with baguette and vegemite – and butter which means I’m still a little bit more Australian. French people don’t put butter on their baguettes – sometimes I have only butter. Not past the finish line with my resident visa with requests to provide more information… and then more… and then more. I’ve asked a friend’s husband to sharpen my knives, and she confirmed it’s for cooking purposes and not slicing a vein 🤣.

There’s a bill being passed by French MPs to support making hospital parking completely free for patients and free for a limited time to visitors. Something that always adds grief whenever a patient or visiting a patient. And completely unrelated but keeping me out of hospital is that I’m now wearing silk gloves under my work gloves… suggested by a skier, I feel like the queen while driving with them on.

And saving the best news until last… kitchens are installed, plumbing complete and an electrician will have wiring finished Monday. I'm such an amateur note: I was on my back under a sink when the installer mentioned the sink wasn't fixed and could be removed to connect the tap 😀. After this milestone I celebrated by buying a new set of pans and taking a day off to visit Toulouse with some friends on a one euro ticket • an initiative of the region to promote tourism. Train was completely packed!

Style of house specific to Toulouse although I've seen many houses in this style in many regions 🤣
