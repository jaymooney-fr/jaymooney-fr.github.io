## Week 3
I now have a French phone number and bank account!! Bit of fun as the phone company wouldn't sign me up without a bank account and I couldn't create an account without a phone number... I've started the process of applying for a driver's licence â€“ there's a facebook group (in English) to walk people through the process. In fact just getting accepted into the group was a complicated process.

I'm still loving the mornings waking to bells chiming and roosters. Visited a photography club during the week, two hour meeting and I understood nothing. We're heading out on a group excursion next weekend where I'll buddy with someone who is sympathetic and is prepared to speak slower. There are also a couple of language groups who meet regularly in Beziers that I'll start joining. ðŸ˜¯

I have ordered a printer/scanner because everything needs a form to be filled in. Amazon and facebook marketplace are both in full swing here and I'm actively looking for a car. Yvanna, a realestate agent I met on the trip earlier this year is taking me around to view some homes this week which means some of the dominos are starting to fall into place.

New phone number is +33 7722 36171 and I've changed this over in WhatsApp. I'll keep the old number roaming for a few more months.
