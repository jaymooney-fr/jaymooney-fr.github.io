## Week 3
I now have a French phone number and bank account!! Bit of fun as the phone company wouldn't sign me up because I didn't have a bank account and I couldn't create an account without a phone number... I've started the process of applying for a driver's licence â€“ there's a facebook group (in English) to walk people through the process. In fact just getting accepted into the group was a complicated process.

I'm still loving the mornings when the church bells chiming and roosters crowing.
