##Week 13

Bonjour is expressed to everyone… even children in supermarket trolleys are prodded to say it if you make eye contact. When you introduce yourself ie my name is Jay, the response is “enchanted”. It would help slightly if they then told me their name, however this is not the custom. Kiss Kiss is at the end of many informal emails and the solicitor’s email signature translates to “Please believe in the assurance of my distinguished greetings". Just to be sure, I double checked an email to the solicitor which included the wording "I have paid my deposit" which had translated to "I have paid my bail".

In French there is a saying “Impossible is not French” with a similar meaning to “nothing is impossible” or “there is no such word as can’t”.

A few ladies from the photography club and I drove up to Montpellier to view an art exposition today. On the way home we passed a lake with hundreds of pink flamingos… I mentioned how beautiful they were… the car went silent so yep, I’m still the new kid in town!! From hundreds of exhibits, the following three show the quality of art from the south of France.
