## Y2 • Week 18
Truly momentous news is that an extension has come through for my permanent residency application. Application is still being processed but I’m no longer an illegal alien. Also this week French Parliament took a major step towards automating residence renewals. Being reviewed by the Senate in Jan 2026 it may be implemented as early as Jul 2026😁

I’ve put my Australian guest to work and we’ve cleared the studio apartment ready to be primed and levelled ready for flooring to be laid. Annoyingly small lengths of metal rod are scattered over the entire area needing to be metal brushed and rustproofed. These rods expanded the concrete and cracked many tiles which have all now been removed.

It’s this week a year ago that I moved in… I live frustrated by my lack of progress but can see things moving in the right direction. I came across a time lapse of a couple renovating a huge château mostly by themselves – over six years 😯

Studio... ceiling and floor causing some grief. Will be happy to post the after photo!

Easy to take beautiful photos on days like these... Tournus
