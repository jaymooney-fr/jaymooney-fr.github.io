## Week 16
The saying goes that you will always remember your first raclette… a winter dish where a grill, sitting table centre heats up and tiny trays containing cooked potatoes and cheese are placed under to melt. Cured meats and pickled veg are then added and OMG I will will always remember.

Amazon sales in Europe toppled last week due to me losing my credit card. Found under the sofa, sales have been reestablished beyond expectation. Does my head in when delivery booked for before 10pm Sat or Sun.

It’s different seeing the country of origin for fruit and veg – Israel, South and Central America, all over Africa, Egypt, Chile and Turkey. All good.

Un péché mignon literally translates as a cute sin. In English a guilty pleasure.
