## Week 41
Exact locations are often and frustratingly not given here. The latest classic was meeting some people at a carpark ‚Äì the address given was the small supermarket in B√©ziers, on the road going to P√©zenas (20 mins away). The equivalent directions in Australia would be ‚Äúit‚Äôs the Woolworths on Gympie Road‚Äù. For non-Brisbane people, Gympie Road is a very long road. A group of us were out walking when we stopped while crossing a dirt road to let some cyclists pass. We clapped as they went by, just like it's done in the Tour de France.

The recently interned pope‚Äôs tombstone has made international news due to the letterspacing (kerning) of his name. Easy to get wrong, so I‚Äôm including a game for a bit of fun. https://type.method.ac/ (drag the letters left or right until the spacing looks equal). ü§£

I‚Äôve entered black and white abstract photos into an exhibition by the club where I‚Äôm a member. We'll hang over 100 photos at a winery domain for public viewing.

And more showing off... fireworks, a gentle breeze and a two second exposure.

Still taking things out... nearly ready to start adding a new shower and toilet here in the studio.
