## Y2 • Week 12
Verandah half up and doors going in next week. Armistice day Tuesday (holiday) so most people are not back at work until Wednesday – Monday is a bridging day respectfully given as a day off. For me it means nine days of work spread over three weeks 😯 Old, cranky and disrespectful builder is living with me during the week and driving me insane! Happy with his workmanship which is what I’ll remember once he’s finished and returned home to his wife.

Weather alert was given through the week as storms approached (we ended up with 1.5mm of rain). Being the opportunist, I headed out for a sunset and supermoon photo but grey skies it was. Still beautiful and an opportunity to find out where to stand for next time 🤩

And just to fill a third paragraph… at the scrapyard while a neighbour was helping get rid of some rubbish metal, we parked along with other cars waiting to unload. I asked whether we should help the old geezer in front unload to speed things up, but the response was negative and “not what French people do”. I’ve since verified that this is not correct and lending a hand to an elderly person is very important. All the while a crane with its huge claw swung over the top of us with its shadow… OMG I didn’t know whether to stay in the van or run to reception.

Half the deck... I'm very happy 😊

Missed the supermoon but still loving where I live!

Little village called Sauvian... on the local bus route but I'd not stopped. Finally had a coffee and walk around – it's lovely.
