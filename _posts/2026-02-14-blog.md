## Y2 • Week 26
Held an inaugural oven, stove and dishwasher lunch to celebrate electricity connection 😁. A few women and their partners came over and we cooked crepes. Took us a while to sort out how to turn on the induction stovetop, get the right heat and then season a new pan – in the end it was a production line with perfect crepes and fillings.

Weather has settled after winds of over 120km/hour through the week. Massive trees were uprooted throughout Béziers including one in my street which took out a newly installed streetlight and bus shelter. Apart from this hiccup, roadworks are almost finished with new line markings and signage in place.

In a group of French people who are all smokers I was asked whether I smoked… on answering in the negative they replied “well it’s never too late” 😯. I wasn’t courageous enough to answer that I didn’t need to spend the money, I’d just keep passively inhaling what they were exhaling.

I’m typing this blog in front of my last fireplace. Using up all remaining timber tonight, I’ll then modernise and use methylated spirits – not so much for the heat but the ambience. Weather is warming up – but remains cool so it’s still nice jumping into bed with the electric blanket on low – yes, I am a wimp!

This is why we are not allowed to rewire our own homes!! How would you know where to start?

Perfect crepes 😁 somebody took ownership of the cooking and the rest of us took ownership of the eating!

After a year of drought and then weeks of rain the strong winds had a field day.
