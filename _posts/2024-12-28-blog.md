## Week 19
Most days I pop out the back door and pick an orange to have with brekky. Not the case with the mandarins which are too sour so I’m stocking up on sugar and buying mason jars online. My neighbour mentioned the fig tree and me not understanding, agreed that it was hanging over his fence and I’d cut it back. Lost in translation as he was saying not to cut it back as they are very good figs and his family love them. It was shockingly windy the two days before Christmas and all the olives fell so I’ve bought a rake and following you-tube for pickling.

12° and sun shining at midday, however 1° in the mornings with car iced over. Not complaining… just an observation as aircon fixes everything! I have a fireplace that I’m not using as it’s too much trouble for just me – people coming over for dinner in three weeks – might  ask them to light it.

Gloves come with tools here. I now have four sets that came with the office chair, vice, rake and drill. I’m so used to the picture saying “does not include…”. Twice I’ve gained attention at the local supermarket – once I walked through at an empty register only to be told to enter at the proper place. Secondly I queued in an aged/handicapped register and was asked for my identification (I think). Cashier let me through eventually with all three items.

Within 10 mins walk from home... a roundabout – check out the castle in the middle.

I'll do proper before and after pics as I renovate. This is area will become kitchen and living.
