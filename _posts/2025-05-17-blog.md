## Week 39
A work colleague from Brisbane and his partner visited this week and I got to show off. Revisiting some spots I think are exceptional, and then hopping off the highway to discover the unknown – it was perfect. I’m back home alone with a jackhammer and the ugliest dog I’ve ever known (dog sitting).

I’m always asked whether I miss anything from Oz, and the stock answer is “not the people because I talk often to family and friends”. It's not true. After dropping Matt and Kez off to return to Australia, I now miss our conversations that ran way past midnight, I miss our nightly ritual dice game, and sharing some great meals. And of course I miss my kids, and the friends and family of 10, 20, 30 40+ years that I grew up with, that I’ve worked with, lived near, camped with, discussed business ideas with, and friends because we had kids at the same school. ❤️
