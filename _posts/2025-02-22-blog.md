## Week 27
It’s been a fun week this week revisiting both Béziers and surrounding villages with a visitor. We sat through a truly excellent presentation on the creation of the Canal du Midi – projected on both side and front walls making you feel like you were part of the story. The canal is 240km long, 2m deep, construction started in 1667 and took 14 years to build by 11 thousand men and 600 women.

We also revisited the medieval city of Carcassonne with its famous fortress castle and a great art gallery – taking the country roads and every so often turning off to see “what’s down there?”. Somebody asked me once “how many pictures of rusty old bolts do you need?”. Same same for abandoned homes and quaint village streets I’m thinking 😁 

Birds are loving the unkept backyard. It’s been a bit overcast and windy during the last few days so they’ve been holding on tight and enjoying the ride, chirping away happily. There’s a big old cat that visits… staring up at them hungrily, no danger to the birds though.

Off the beaten track...

The little village of Ferrals-les-Corbiers. I think maybe the witch fell off her mop navigating the alleyways.
