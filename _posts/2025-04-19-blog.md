## Week 34
Stopped and hopped out the car to take a photo… and could hear cowbells on a distant hill. Was telling somebody about this and she said “Jay, I lived in Switzerland for 20 years – and they go all night – it’s awful”. I thought it was nice for three minutes 😯

I told my first joke in French! A group of us were out bushwalking when there was some approaching engine noise. In French, somebody said that it was quad bikes… and I replied in French that I thought it was the Germans… and they understood 😁

Was invited to lunch at a café 20 mins drive away – followed by a short walk along the river Orb. I hadn’t seen this neck of the woods before – very pretty. Booking required as the café is always packed and the food excellent… I may have eaten too much!

Taking out non structural walls upstairs – The wall to the left of the photo is hanging by a thread and coming down this weekend.

Springtime – yellow flowers and red poppies lining kerbsides everywhere.
