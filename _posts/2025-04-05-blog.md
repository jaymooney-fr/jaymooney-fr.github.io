##Week 33
Finally was courageous enough to turn off internal heating to the wall mounted radiators in every room â€“ which means I can now remove them. Stupidly went out wearing only one layer and froze while walking around Narbonne and Gruissan, 40 mins drive south-east of BÃ©ziers. Both beautiful and historically significant showing off cathedrals, village squares (more places of revolution), fortresses and salt marshes. Nearly drove through the pedestrian street marketplace but a left turn appeared which was lucky ðŸ˜¯.

After many false starts and unanswered emails, have twice attended a French lesson held near home. Ukrainians, Columbians, Arabs and Australians â€“ all of us learning French. Havenâ€™t any idea how long the course goes for, the cost or what level is being taught or whether itâ€™s provided for refugeesâ€¦ but itâ€™s nice to have a structured course with homework. Not only are we learning the language, but the French wayâ€¦ which is truly relaxed re providing information.

Spring has sprung with the plum tree in full bloom and new growth on the fig, almond, citrus and a few other trees that Iâ€™m still waiting to see what they turn into. Iâ€™ve started propagating vegetables from seeds, slow going as weather remains mostly overcast and windy. The birds are loving the trees, and I am loving watching them jump through the branches. Every so often gulls land â€“ some are massive with wing spans of more than a metre. The visiting cat remains on high alert!

Even more Narbonne... the end.
