## Y2 • Week 14
Christmas lights are being turned in Béziers tonight. I intended trekking into town to watch the spectacle, but it’s too cold. I’ve started leaving the butter out as it’s colder on the bench than in the fridge. Not complaining as I’m comfortable in three layers and thick socks, and have bought electric blankets for Aussie visitors arriving December…

Stage two of build is now complete with bifold doors and the verandah which ended up a metre wider (builder error 😁). I have lots of work to do before kitchens arrive end of January. And then lots more to do to before being liveable. On Friday I heard back re visa application – a request for more information… needing a translator accredited by the court of appeal. I’m still nervous, but a step closer.

Sometimes I think nothing has happened during the week and then I look back through photos... My street atm.

May need to enlarge photo to see birds... thousands fly around morning and dusk.
