## Week 11

Hostplus have changed their mind regarding me being an international money launderer and released my Super! Never have so many things been so out of my control including a lock on my Microsoft account which was sorted with chat easily after hours of trying all past usernames and passwords.

There are a few things including vegemite, crunchy peanut paste, Lurpak butter and Serina tuna that I’m missing. And Antoniou filo pastry for the baklava and spinach and fetta pie that I’m famous for (in my dreams!). There are many alternatives here and I’m starting to make known recipes with new ingredients. Possibly a firing squad offence, but this week I sat down to ratatouille with fried rice for dinner!

The new Kia has great satnav, predictive cruise control and lane keeping… on the highway I set the speed to 130km/hr and it kept me in the lane, adjusted to the speed of the car in front and changed to new limits when a speed limit changed. The lane keeping is so good that it turned me off the highway exit for home and when I tried taking my hands off the wheel, I was ordered to return them. It's a hybrid and I achieved well over 800kms on a 40 litre tank.

It’s against the law to name a pig Napolean in France and the truly great news is mosquitoes have disappeared with winter approaching.

Drove up to a Sète an hour north of Béziers.

Spinach and Fetta with puff pastry... I thought I was buying fillo! Didn't matter, I've never had a puff pastry I didn't like.

Capestang is a closeby village to Beziers famous for its cathedral and many eating places.

Inside the Cathedral is breathtaking.
