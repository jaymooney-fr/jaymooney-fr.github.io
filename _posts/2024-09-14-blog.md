## Week 4

True story, when you register a dog in Beziers, the Vets do a DNA test. So if you leave crap on the ground, you get a fine. It's still being trialled and in many places footpaths are nice and clean... and in some areas the humans need more training.

A funny wtf moment – at the photography group we were asked to pay for an upcoming function. 20 people dug into their bags and pockets and pulled out chequebooks...

I've cleared two screens of apps from my mobile, including SBS on demand and ABC Iview – neither available here. I can still get ABC Classic radio so I'm happy. It's beautiful heading off to sleep and hearing the morning show being broadcast.

I've bought a KIA Niro SUV Hybrid – picking up next week. First big trip will be down to Spain which is just over an hour away (south).
