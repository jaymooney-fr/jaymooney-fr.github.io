## Y2 ‚Ä¢ Week 6
I love visiting villages not seen before as much as I love revisiting favourites. Aussie visitors and I hit the jackpot with Minerve on the way home from Carcassonne during the week. Truly beautiful and less than 50km from home ‚Äì we stopped for an exquisite lunch at a restaurant perched on the edge of a gorge. It tops my list of ‚Äúmust show off attractions‚Äù for future visitors‚Ä¶ until a new one is discovered ü§©.

Plum season was finalised by baking cakes and making chutney. The cool change in weather has been welcome ‚Ä¢ needing jackets some days, but not gloves yet. Had forgotten how windy it gets and realise that I again need a haircut.

Wine in France is named by location and not type‚Ä¶ so labels read Ch√¢teau whatever in Bordeaux rather than cabsav. There is such a glut of wine that the French government is subsidising farmers to change their crops over to olives.
