## Week 22
According to my phone, this week 12 months ago I had just arrived in France and was setting off across Europe with 3 friends in a hired car… we hit snow in Belgium which didn’t seem to slow anybody down except us. No snow here in Béziers, however the Kia is warning me to be careful on the icy roads... which they are not (yet). Call me a wuss, I’ve bought fur lined boots for working in the garden!

This week an English speaking builder and architect popped in to talk about house plans. Most importantly two walls need to disappear. If I have money left over it would be nice to have a cover on the back deck and timber flooring inside… I’ll keep you posted! I looked up an auction site to find paintings and ended up putting a low bid on a bronze, signed by the French artist – which I now happily own. Not sure how that happened 😯

Not too windy, I've had a haircut and so venturing out and about on foot discovering more beautiful gems. Walking through the “Jardin médiéval Saint Jean des Anneaux” (Medieval garden of Saint John of the Rings), I wandered around vegie patches full of produce with signs up warning that it’s forbidden to pick anything. Closeby by are ancient parks, with the conservatory of music and an open air theatre nestled in the middle. Still loving it 😍

Within 10 mins walk from home – the medieval garden.

And the garden comes with a chateau, or vice versa.
