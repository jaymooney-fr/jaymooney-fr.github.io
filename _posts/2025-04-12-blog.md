## Week 34
Made it to Barcelona! On the way down, stopped at the home of Salvador Dalí located in Portlligat (Spain) and now owned by the state – and being run as a very successful tourist stop. Caught the bus and train and walked a lot around Barcelona which was more beautiful than I’d anticipated. Lots of people now that it’s warming up, and a lot more motorhomes on the roads. Trying to get to a monument the satnav gave me an incorrect turnoff, advising me to rectify my route 4kms down the road… which again didn’t exist and was advised to reroute 6km further on. 10km each way and I was back where I’d started. Keen to see the monument (three chimneys 650 feet tall) I started out again thinking I would take more care. Ended up on the exact same route a second time, so headed back to the accommodation for tapas and a glass of sangria.

Homeward bound, stopped at Montserrat – a spectacularly beautiful Benedictine monk mountain retreat. Then continuing north drove into Berga, a smaller village with even smaller streets. Tucked the mirrors in as it was inches between car and some deeply gouged walls from less fortunate drivers.

Crossed the Pyrenees back into France in a village where street signs changed from Spanish to French along the one road. During covid, vaccination instructions differed between the two countries and in this little village there existed two rulebooks. Back in France stopped at Mont-Louis – the highest fortified town in France and the military occupation continues.

Nice to be back home in my own bed!
