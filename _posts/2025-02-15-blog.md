## Week 26
Six month anniversary this week 😁 and a builder finally sent his quote. There are a few things that I won’t get done straight away, however the important ones will go ahead starting April. Bit excited that an Oz visitor arrived this week in amongst the renovations. We’re plotting places to see – naturally I’ll post photos.

An almond tree in the backyard has blossoms (if it’s an almond tree?). I’ve picked the last orange for the season, mandarins remain inedible and I’m about to start pruning… days are generally beautiful and sunny with the weather gradually warming. Last night we had the fireplace roaring, testing it before the end of winter.

I’m still removing wallpaper and polystyrene, however the plaster and paint was delivered this week so I’ll soon be able to start on the walls that are staying. Every time I go to start something I realise that something else needs to be finished first which is annoying me 🤩

Truly orange pumpkin and a romanesco cauliflower – don't think I've seen one before but rich in vitamins C and K according to Google.

One day I'll wake up and it will all be finished!

Aerial shot of the studio ceiling – has been challenging. It's a hoot that even the cornices were polystyrene.
