## Week 38
Went on a 15km hike last Sunday in Montpeyroux ‚Äì 40 mins north on the highway. Advertised on a tourism website the event included coffee at a cellar door, walking through gorges and past old castles, to a chateau for morning tea (which I thought was lunch) and then back to the cellar door for lunch with a wine tasting. In amongst 50 other adventurers I found an empty chair and was immediately befriended by three couples, all with interesting stories. Still not understanding much so slowly, slowly. The French word for having an affair is ‚Äúaventure‚Äù ‚Äì learned with the Duolingo app, not personal experience!

Also this week, and with two English speaking ladies, I visited the ancient fortified city Ens√©rune founded around 575 BC. Discovered in the 1850s, archaeological digs started in the early 1900s and a modern museum now shows the history. Established on a hilltop there is a magic 360¬∞ view, and it‚Äôs a 15 min drive from home. üòÅ

On the home front, finally braved going to the tip/dump/recycling centre. Five minute drive from home, and with a friend of a friend who owns a van, we loaded a whole heap of s&%t and dropped it off. I‚Äôm now registered so when I drive up, the boom gate opens by number plate recognition ‚Äì I feel so much lighter. Through the week I needed an angle grinder and a sander‚Ä¶ and I had both although I‚Äôd forgotten I‚Äôd bought a sander...

On the hike, happy to be wearing fir lined work boots and wolly socks due to rough rubble.
