##Week 23

Every time I rolled over in bed earlier this week the room spun truly violently… without street drugs. Dr Google put my mind at rest as nothing serious and I’m back in action after a few quiet days. Enjoyed a book while resting – “The spy of Venice: A William Shakespeare Novel". Cleverly written, and receiving mixed reviews, I loved it and it’s a free Brisbane library audiobook (BorrowBox).

Unexpected pleasure finding filo pastry at a Turkish shop in walking distance. Life has been restored with a tray of baklava plus a spinach and feta pie made for impressing – let the parties continue! Also within a few minutes walk is a popup market where storekeepers peddle their wares Tue, Thu and Sat mornings selling clothes one day and food the next. Afterwards the streets reopen for traffic.

Australia Day barbeque was beautiful. Neighbours enjoyed meeting each other, and a few had as much English as I have French… and we all managed.
