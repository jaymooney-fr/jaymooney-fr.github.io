## Week 36
Motored along the canal du Midi from Béziers to the little village of Poilhes through the week. Two hours each way stopping for lunch before returning. Great bunch of people, a few dogs and we were in the care of a skilled skipper. Something else now ticked off the “To Do List”.

Downloaded an app to see what plants are flowering in the garden. Additional fruit trees and bushes identified are pomegranate, blackberry, wild asparagus and wine grape (how did I not know this one!).

Thank goodness for Amazon. I knocked a powerpoint which blew a fuse – nothing dodgy with the current wiring! Fuse box contains the old ceramic fuses used in the 70s. There are 10A, 16A and 20A fuses and I didn’t know which one had blown. Ordered a pack on Amazon containing two of each delivered the next day for under four euros. Handy because half the house and the hot water system were on the blown fuse. Removing a wall today to locate a leak coming from the shower. If there’s no blog next week, I’ll have found my way through to the land of Narnia.

New office desk made from recycled wall panelling and a circular saw. Still needing an edge to be added.

Fact: I did not know Lilac was a plant... and just like the colour!
