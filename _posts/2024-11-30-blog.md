## Week 15

I’ve just returned home from a 12 euro show in the old Béziers theatre. Nearly didn’t go because it was cold, went for three hours and I really didn’t understand what I’d booked for. Braved the odds to see a show that was truly spectacular. First bit was French dialogue with a lady dying and I could only pick out words. After 20 minutes it was 14 incredibly talented musicians sending her off at her wake. Standing ovation.

My boxes arrived from Australia. I opened the one carrying my camera… it’s another domino falling into place that can now be ticked off the list.

The magic 3D pictures on the walls in Béziers are a documented thing. Called trompe-l'oeil (trick of the eye) there are 16 on a map showing their addresses. I haven’t seen them all but will do the touristy thing when I live there! There’s an app for the buses in Béziers and as I was checking the route the bus was moving along the map letting me know when to be at the bus stop. That’s possibly in Bris now however it wasn’t when I caught the train into the city not too long ago.

One more trick of the eye. Except for the top windows, everything is a painting.
