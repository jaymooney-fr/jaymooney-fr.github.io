## Week 10

The really great news is that I signed a house contract on Thursday. A hiccup has occured with HostPlus locking my superannuation account due to identity issues ie I'm using an Australian address and a French phone number – will be sorted out next week. It's been a bit funny negotiating the complications that pop up and OMG I'm happy living in a generation where I can drag French .pdfs into google translate and out they pop in English.

It's currently raining cats and dogs here with thunder and lightening thrown in. The rental house doesn't have eaves, so doors and windows are closed which I'm not used to. I'll be adding a roof over the deck in my new home if HostPlus play nice. I mentioned to the builder I'd like a corrugated tin roof. He said that it would sound like a freight train when in rained... and I said yep – I'm from Australia! Some other differences are that chocolate pieces are larger 3x5cm – this is good isn't it? Flocks of birds in the thousands fly over regularly before landing in the same tree.

Since I've been in Serignan I thought I lived near a rifle range... I think now that it's just firecrackers as I hear the same pop pop whereever I am, even on a bushwalk miles from civilisation. Of course I can't rule out another revolution. Church bells chime regularly which I'm still loving and it makes me smile as it's always 5 mins past the hour – no idea why and I'm certain that nobody would be able to tell me.

I took a selfie.

The start and finish of the bushwalk was at a church.

And this is why I moved to the south of France.
