## Week 29
We still have 1 cent (euro) coins in circulation here. It‚Äôs funny receiving little bits of change and amazing that everyone waits patiently while small coins are counted out to pay at the checkout. More than once I‚Äôve run into Aldi thinking I‚Äôll pop in and out in 10 min and it took 20.

After trying unsuccessfully to find a beginners‚Äô French course in B√©ziers, Agde just 20 mins up the road seemed to be the next option. Nearly ran over a dog while parking which started a conversation with two ladies who spoke English and were also going to the course. The Red Cross course was not at the address advertised, but a 100m walk known to them which was lucky. Unlucky was that they were full and not taking in people from B√©ziers. It‚Äôs comic the amount of wrong addresses, wrong times and general lack of right information. As with everything I‚Äôve struggled with, eventually a helpful person appears üòÅ

In Agde and S√®te (the next village) there are some museums, galleries and the incredible restored home of an eccentric millionaire (Le Ch√¢teau Laurens). One of the art galleries was half closed for renovations but still had a full entrance price‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt decide whether to enter or not. A very helpful lady at the front counter said she was the only person who spoke English, and if I showed her my phone, people would think I had bought a ticket online and entrance would be free. Some of the best artwork I‚Äôve ever seen!

Just one room of Le Ch√¢teau Laurens. Another room has 25 metre ceilings.

Black gravel beach in Agde... and of course I dipped my feet in!

Went for a walk and stopped for a picnic lunch with three other ladies at Roquebrun... 40 mins drive from B√©ziers.
