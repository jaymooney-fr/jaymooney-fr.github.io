## Week 2
During the week I moved from Beziers to a rental in S√©rignan. I'm sharing the four bedroom home with a flatmate for a few weeks, and renovations are due to start in October. I have a full kitchen again which is great and naturally I've invited the neighbours in for dinner one night next week.

I've a system for people not understanding me, I translate on my phone and then say what I need to in French. When they don't understand me, I show them the phone. Works every time. My flatmate doesn't speak any English, so it's slow going... I feel I know lots of words but putting them into sentences remains challenging.

Weather has been really warm... heating is installed everywhere but no cooling. I spent ages in the local supermarket meat section, both for the cold and for the jaw dropping high prices. Carrefour the supermarket is a combination of Target, Woolworths, BWS and a live seafood section.

After months of dominos falling into place before leaving, I'm now working on them falling again here for customs, bank, mobile, car, social security number, health card and buying a house üòÅ

Of course I walked to the top of the cathedral!

AirBnb in Beziers was lovely (except for the stairs)

Centre of Serignan, place of twilight markets and revolution (not this century)
