## Y2 • Week 27
On arriving here I read a book about the French resistance – not even knowing what it was. And I’ve just finished a book including the Templar history… religion, royalty and espionage set right here in the Languedoc during the 1100s. Not so many books set in Brisbane, however the Mayne Inheritance became significant – while lying on a sofa in the West End unit, and with my head on an angle, and through a quarter corner window, I could see Moorlands House – a grand home from the 1800s built by a member of the Mayne family.

This week was full of learnings. Starling flocks (European) swirling magically through skies in formation are called murmurations. Like tornadoes people follow and film these… you need to look it up! Morning and night I get to witness this spectacle.

Another learning this week was that my favourite hardware is not open Sundays… and that concrete is mixed more sand than cement… requiring some removal and rebuilding. Two steps forward, one back 😯

The builder left some rough edges which I'm fixing one by one...

After asking for advice, I'm plastering rough edges.

I'd like to say that this is the before photo – however it's a blurry middle that will one day be my garden of Versailles... little fountain in a neat garden!
