## Y2 â€¢ Week 7
After nipping down to Barcelona dropping off Aussie visitors, itâ€™s back to work on the house after a few weeks of leisure. Plasterboard is up on one side of all new walls and the electrician is running wires. Then Iâ€™ll add insulation and finish off the other side. Iâ€™m tackling the guest shower and toilet which are smaller rooms and fiddly, hoping the bigger rooms will then be easier.

Ducked out late one afternoon for a walk along the beach with two local couples, and Iâ€™ve been invited to join a group of four women who meet for coffee every Sunday morningâ€¦ which is good because I have started talking to myself ðŸ˜¯

I continue finding beautiful things to take photos ofâ€¦ using the mobile â€“ camera being safely tucked away from dust. It will be a happy day when I have the gusto again to set up a tripod.

No idea what the plant is, but it is pretty.

Natural beauty close to home reminding me of the blue mountains.
