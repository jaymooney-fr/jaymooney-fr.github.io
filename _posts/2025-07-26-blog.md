## Week 49
Flooring came this week – delivered to the footpath… have carried them all inside and once I recover, I’ll move half upstairs. There’s a mongrel false wall I'm removing in the upstairs bathroom causing grief, so I’ve ordered a bigger angle grinder from Amazon 😁. In the reviews was a comment that people who had bought this item had also bought… tinned sardines in tomato sauce!

A couple from Aus dropped in for a coffee on the way back to their newly settled unit in Casargo Italy – it was good to swap stories about buying property in different European countries. Another couple here in Béziers then invited me to a second-hand warehouse staffed by refugees who I understand are provided with accommodation and work. Nothing is priced, so you take items to staff members and haggle. The agreed prices are written on tickets – you keep the tickets, they keep your items. When you have finished shopping, tickets are taken to a main cashier who takes your money and stamps the tickets as paid. You then return to swap tickets for paid items and walk out the shed with no proof of payment… my 5€ outlay was a cheap price for the “how to knowledge”.

Our mayor this week commented that 13 year old drug traffickers are bastards and should be locked up in prison… he’s very popular for many decisions – it will be interesting to see what the public feel about this one. Still local, in France we have Pine Martens – unlikely to be seen, but they look cute. And I’ve watched segments of the Tour de France for the first time • because “When in France…”.

I feel my arms are ½" longer.

Think possum... agile and superb climbers often jumping from tree to tree.
