## Y2 • Week 17
Spent this week being tourist rather than tour guide 🤩 Headed 500 kilometres north to Rancy for three nights visiting friends of my Aussie guest. The couple drove us around and cooked nonstop. There are 96 departments in mainland France, numbered by their name alphabetically. Hérault where I live is 34 shown on my number plate and in my postcode (34500). While away we visited Ain markets (department 01) and then had rabbit for dinner • a special day!!

Heading home we stopped to check out Cluny Abbey started in 910 and restored recently, after being ruined during the revolution. Also stopped at Garabit viaduct started in 1880 and built by Gustave Eiffel. It was the largest metal structure in the world – and a practice run for the Eiffel Tower. We were then diverted off the main highway by farmers protesting the government's strategy on euthanising herds of cows due to a contagious nodular disease running rampant. This was a good thing (being diverted, not the killing of cows) as we drove through more small and beautiful villages.
