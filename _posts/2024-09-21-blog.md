## Week 5

Picked up the car on Friday... another KIA. Not as flash as the one back home however we're up for some great adventure. On Friday I also put in an offer on a house. It's been accepted at 200,000 Eur + Notary fees (16,000 Eur) which at current rate is ($355,000 AUD) â€“ a five bedroom 70's that needs lots of work but that's why I'm here. Hopefully move in before Christmas.

Through the week I woke up during the night to a gentle breeze and the moon shining in onto my face... turns out it was a supermoon so I'm glad it woke me up. Up until this week the days have been really windy but not cold. This week calmer and a bit drizzly.

In France you are allowed to mow your lawn on Sundays and public holidays but only between 10:00 and 12:00. These times were decided by a 1992 law designed to avoid unnecessary noise pollution.

What would a blog be without one food photo!

Art expo at a local chateau... not for royalty, just a fine house in it's day.

Missing my campera which is in the shipping container. Also missing my potato peeler - it's the small things.

Typical house in Serignan - nice to photograph.
