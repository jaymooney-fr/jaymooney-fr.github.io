## Week 45
Our first concert for the choir was held last night… with six other choirs we took our turns – the first bracket went from 4-7pm, stopped for dinner, second bracket went from 9pm-12:30am. Add in an hour drive back and after dropping a few members to their homes, hit my pillow at nearly 2am… it’s been a long time since I’ve missed curfew by this many hours.

On the way to the concert I got hopelessly lost. I’d typed in venue and village and it landed me at a beautiful old church a km out of town. My two passengers tried to help by suggesting other addresses. Eventually somebody rang to see where I was, and I very calmly (and possibly a bit frustratedly) said “I need a street name and a number”.

Not wanting to complain about how hot it is however the Aldi cheese fridge is looking tempting today! French computer keyboards are not QWERTY, they are AZERTY. And simple things like the exclamation mark are tricky to find.

The ancient remains of the church of Our Lady of the Oubiels in Portel-des-Corbières – not our concert venue, but worth the detour for this photo.

You know what they say about teaching old dogs new tricks!
