## Week 47
Hallelujah itâ€™s raining. After two months of dry heatwave, weâ€™re experiencing an Australian thunder storm in BÃ©ziers. Ceaseless shots of lightning, booms of thunder and a sensational breeze. New batch of Aussie visitors from my old Brisbane photo club got to see Carcassonne in the rain today after three days of sightseeing in brilliant sunshine. Not sure theyâ€™re impressed but Iâ€™m overjoyed!

Was charged for parking in the equivalent of a Westfield shopping centre this week. Needed a photobooth photo which took less than 20 mins â€“ free parking if you spend more than two hours shopping ðŸ¤£

Within a ten minute drive from home, the Fonseranes locks of BÃ©ziers are eight successive oval locks and gates allowing boats to be lowered/raised 21 metres to match the canal du midi to the Mediterranean sea. Designed for trade, and now used exclusively for pleasure craft, itâ€™s listed as a Unesco world heritage site.

The locks in action... takes about 5 minutes to fill or empty a chamber.
