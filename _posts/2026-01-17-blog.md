## Y2 • Week 22
Another Aussie friend talking about coming over for an adventure holiday and to help out in March. Good news is it won’t be so cool, and I’ll have a shower working. This week I’ve invested in new boots and thermals – weather remains freezing. The main fountain in Béziers has frozen over and I threw an ice disc from the top of a water bucket into the garden… and it sat there laughing at me all day.⛄

I’m a few steps closer to kitchen install in two weeks. Plumbing and painting this week and then laying the floor… I’m looking forward to sharing this photo!! A successful day for me is doing plumbing all day and not having to visit a hardware. Sometimes I hit the jackpot, other times I visit one shop that doesn’t have the part and head to the next!

A few more food photos below… and now that I’m back alone it’s baked beans on toast. Last restaurant visited was a local, newly opened Japanese establishment where a robot brought our drinks to the table… waited for us to collect and then after pressing a return button zoomed off.

Before and after... same boots, different year. 😁
