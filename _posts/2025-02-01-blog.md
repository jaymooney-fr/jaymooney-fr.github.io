## Week 24
Another day of food celebration looms: La Chandeleur: ‘Pancake Day’ on Feb 2. A Christian celebration 40 days after Christmas celebrated by eating crepes. I’m heading out shortly to buy ingredients. Great news is I still have money
after spending nearly €2000 on rendering plaster and paint. Apart from pulling a few things down, I haven't really started renovations... and I need to.

I was asked out to walk 5km around a pond at the seaside port of Peyriac-de-Mer through the week (40 mins from home). The day was spectacular with blue sky, no wind and a flamboyance of pink flamingos (yep I looked that one up). Whether turned towards evening with a storm and pea sized hail – sunny again today with a light breeze.

I continue to find niceties in this tiny corner of Béziers where I live – at the end of my street is a café, corner store, bakery, butcher, fresh produce, post office and atm. Not as upmarket as West End, but more affordable for sure.

From my bedroom window. In amongst the fruit trees I'm planning raised timber garden beds.

Within 10 mins walk from home... showing Beziers city and Cathedral in the distance (10 mins drive away).
