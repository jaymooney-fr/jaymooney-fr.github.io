## Y2 ‚Ä¢ Week 8
Spent five hours chiselling two doors and jambs to fit new mechanisms and handles‚Ä¶ have three more to go which will be faster because they are recycled doors from downstairs, they‚Äôll be painted and I‚Äôve bought a kilo of timber cement! Electrician has finished upstairs roughly, and added a new switchbox ‚Äì which will trip if I do anything stupid ü§£

I joined the photography group for a walk along part of Lake Salagou (an hour north) yesterday‚Ä¶ a man-made reservoir started in 1964 and taking five years to complete. Red soil contrasting against blue water produced some nice reflections and fantastic photos.

All noise grievances are over and the elderly couple who invited me in to meet their family last month have agreed to meet regularly to chat in French. Early days, but they came over last night and we talked for two hours using google translate regularly but not always. I got stuck on explaining that a French lady I know had a son while she lived in Australia but has returned to France with him‚Ä¶ and they thought I was saying the son lived with his father in Australia ‚Äì it was confusing but eventually the translator put us right üòÅ

Eight people, two dogs, all stopping for morning tea, lunch and lots of photos.
