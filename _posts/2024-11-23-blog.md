## Week 14

Went for a drive to a small village earlier in the week to pick up something bought on Facebook marketplace. Stopped to walk down the main street (three shops, a church and a place of revolution). Blue sky, Autumn colours and a nip in the air from snow falling not too far away… the love affair continues. Don’t feel I’ve really been anywhere yet but the car’s showing almost 2000km. Every day I’m thankful to make it home with two mirrors – I swear a bus was going to remove one of them in Béziers yesterday!

After weeks of diligent work the painters are almost finished in the home I’m renting. I’ll miss their banter and my learning how to prep walls. Builder’s then moving in for a few days to install insulated bifold doors that came from Poland… he’s agreed to quote on my place soon after I pick up keys, and no, still no firm date for moving in.

Exchange rate hit a 12 month high late this week so I’ve now converted all of my uninvested dollars to euros. The rate is still horrible but I feel a little bit in front and relieved to have all the money exchanged before the house settles. An aussie let me know that it’s cheaper to buy vegemite and tim tams in the UK… go figure with the current exchange rate.
