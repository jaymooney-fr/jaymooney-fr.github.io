## Y2 • Week 20
Great new year’s eve with friends, and baklava (mine) for brekky new year's day. I’ve watched more videos this week than in the last two years – all in front of a roaring fire. Also rendered a wall which took three days to dry due to low temperatures. Sanding and painting this week and then tackling floors 😯

Also hit the mother of all payloads this week with a trip to Cirque de Navacelles. Many times I’ve passed signs on the highway, but never made the detour. OMG insanely awesome!!
