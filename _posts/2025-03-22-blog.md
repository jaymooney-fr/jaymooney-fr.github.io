## Week 31
Finally plucked up the courage to join the local choir. 20 to 30 men and women, who warmly greeted me explaining that friendship is just as important to them as the music. My singing capacity is on par with the others (not a high level) and word recognition is even lower – and I enjoyed myself heaps.

Went on a walk through a different corner of Béziers ending up at Villa Antonine Garden – the summer home and garden of Jean-Antonin Injalbert (b.1845) who was a renown sculptor and whose works are dotted around France. Still loving Béziers.

There is a Festival Flamenco happening this week and ventured out to a small theatre to see a trio performing. Talented dancer and guitarist, however a bit too contemporary for me. Fortunately had seats right up the back closest to the exit for a quick escape!

In Toulon on the home leg from Corsica, drove up Mt Faron and found a discreet enclosed fort begun in 1764 under the reign of King Louis XV.

We drove up Mt Faron rather than taking the cable car – scaring the shit out of everyone, including me.
