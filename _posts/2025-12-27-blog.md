## Y2 • Week 19
Last blog for this year and some repetition because I’m on holidays! I hope you have a great last week heading into 2026 ❤️ Happy new year.

Celebrated Christmas lunch in style at a spiffy restaurant in downtown Béziers. Spacing out courses were tiny delicacies – all finished off with cheeses, dessert and coffee. Rolled back home thinking it will be good to repeat same again next year!

Revisited Abbeye de Fontfroide and a favourite cathedral in Narbonne, and the Gruissan salt marsh – as tour guide this week. In amongst the local hardware, Aldi and tip (transfer station) – an all included adventure vacation with work thrown in for a willing Aussie.

Rabbit and veg – had a much fancier title that I couldn't translate.
