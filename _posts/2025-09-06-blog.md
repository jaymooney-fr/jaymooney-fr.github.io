## Y2 ‚Ä¢ Week 3
Revisited P√©zenas this week with some friends, a village 20 minutes north that I love. Lots of history, cobblestone streets, art shops and lunch at a lovely caf√©. Cranky builder has now finished stage one, stage two (deck and bifold doors) will happen end of October. Electrician starting next week after which I will start tiling and flooring‚Ä¶ a friend helped today to vacuum and mop‚Ä¶ the dust and dirt are both horrible and depressing.

More aussie friends are arriving next week ‚Äì all of us heading out and about using my home as a base camp. We‚Äôll be visiting places I‚Äôve not visited before, and I look forward sharing the experiences üòÅ

The nearby streets where I live are named after insects‚Ä¶ Grillons (Crickets), Cigales (Cicadas), Abeilles (Bees), Papillons (Butterflies), Sauterelles (Grasshoppers), Lucioles (Fireflies), and my favourite‚Ä¶ Libellules (Dragonflies).
