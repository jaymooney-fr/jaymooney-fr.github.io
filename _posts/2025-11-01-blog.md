## Y2 â€¢ Week 11
Timeline error being remedied before the verandah install next week. I realised I needed to paint the wall prior, so after buying paint and using a leftover plank I was able to paint nearly to the top. The builder is lending me an extension ladder so I can finish the last few feet. I felt very Australian taking a reddish leaf with me to choose a paint colour, only to be told it would be too dark and fade quickly. I was talked into a lighter colour, which in the bucket looked pink, however on the wall itâ€™s darker and Iâ€™m happy.

Also this week I finally got my act together and purchased kitchens for the main home and studio apartment. Apart from the aircon, this is the last major expense so spending will slow downâ€¦ phew! Also this week, while lying in bed listening to an audio book, I watched the moon cross from left window frame to rightâ€¦ three hours â€“ itâ€™s the little things ðŸ¤©

Itâ€™s All Saints' Day, a public holiday and very quiet. Somehow mixed up with All Hallows (Halloween) and recognising dead saints. Masses of flowers have been on sale all week and families traditionally visit the gravesites of their deceased relatives today.

Just like Uluru sunset... colour changes between mushroom, peach, plum and nappy brown.

Everchanging view from my bedroom window... satellites, planets, birds and new days.
