## Week 21
Recent archaeological digs prove Béziers is the oldest city in France. Greeks settled here for several centuries after travelling overland 3000 kilometres in 600BC. In front of all shopping centres are washing machines and dryers… you pop your washing on and head into the warmth, both things I’m sure the ancient Greeks would have appreciated.

I’m glamping with a stovetop, bathroom, bed, a few appliances and odd furniture. It’s clean and comfortable and will remain as it is while renovations progress. I sent a few creature comforts over from Oz and I relish every day having a cuppa in a favourite mug.

Flatpack bed frames and mattresses arrived from Germany this week (Amazon). Bit challenging getting everything up a narrow staircase but lots of fun putting it all together. And then it’s always a challenge getting rid of the packaging… one day I’ll be brave and head to the dump!

Visitors now have beds. The rooms are still to be renovated with the addition of timber flooring and the subtraction of current lampshades.

It's an easy fix, however stormwater not flowing where it should be.
