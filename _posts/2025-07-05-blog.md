## Week 46
An olive tree has just been installed outside the mayorâ€™s office in the city centre. 2000 years old and transported up from Spain, who knows what peace or civil unrest itâ€™s seen. Seeing much more unprecedented activity now for sure.

I keep seeing vans full of cages containing pigeonsâ€¦ and finally asked someone whether the pigeons were for eating? Nopeâ€¦ racing is a big thing here. And a big thing in Australia too after a google search ðŸ¤©Pressurised water is also a big thing here. Anytime youâ€™re in a group and itâ€™s a bit warm, somebody will pull out a can and spray your face.

Ordered flooring this week, a water resistant timber look laminate that will be laid everywhere including bathroomsâ€¦ bit excited. Also ordered gel knee pads because Iâ€™m feeling old!

This olive tree, about 2,000 years old, comes from an abandoned olive grove in southern Spain. Since ancient times, in all religions, these trees have symbolized wisdom and prosperity.

Removed wall heaters this week... happy to freeze in winter! May change my mind but not until current heat subsides.
