## Week 40
Went to a neighbourhood party Friday night after choir. Not my neighbourhood but a small village not too far away. It‚Äôs an event with over 10 million people taking part all over France. The local mayor dropped in to say hello so I‚Äôm thinking it may be an election year ‚Äì I left just on sunset which sounds early however it was after 9:30pm.

Swapped over plugs on power leads brought over from Australia this week. Mostly computer related ‚Äì I brought over three computers, monitors and other bits requiring change for European sockets. Dad completed both mechanical and electrical trades while in the army during WWII, and afterwards passed along this information to us kids. I did have to Google for a refresher as it‚Äôs been a long time since I was ten.

Joined the photography group yesterday setting out early to Magalas‚Ä¶ a small historic village 20 minutes north. Walked around narrow streets three or four times and then set off for lunch. Felt I‚Äôd had enough, but oh no, we had more places to check off the list‚Ä¶ including a well hidden historic mill. 6:00pm we finally found it, and I‚Äôd lost the will to live. üòÅ All the following photos are in Magalas.

The totally unfindable historic mill... sky made it worth living!
