## Y2 • Week 23
The Orb river flowing through Béziers flooded earlier this week – up over 10m. The city is high and safe however nearby villages have been affected. Thunderstorms today after one beautiful day yesterday when everyone did washing following a week of grey skies. Three month’s worth fell this week – it is beautiful waking up to rain on a tin roof 😀 and the birds are loving it.

A stray cat is visiting… gaining access through a hole in the wall that a toilet pipe will fill as soon as the floor is laid. It took a while to work out that tiny marks in the self levelling compound were paw prints. Very cute but I’m aware of fleas and bed bugs – it must have food because two rats run regularly along a wall in the backyard.

I remain loyal to Amazon who delivered something on a Sunday that I had ordered the day before. Often packets arrive after 8:00pm including some taps I orderered – and then dreamt they were delivered the same day… not true!

Having lived through two floods it was always the first question I asked when looking at houses, the second being internet speed 😁.

City center just before the rain started. I'm wearing two layers of gloves – my little fingers are freezing.
