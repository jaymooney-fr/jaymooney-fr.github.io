## Y2 â€¢ Week 1
At home this week the shower was demolished but a toilet stayed. Iâ€™ve improvised a garden hose in the backyard and wait for the builders to leave before lathering up and taking a breathtakingly refreshing wash. Hot water and new shower hopefully happening during the next few days. This weekend Iâ€™m in Anduze (a pretty village two hours northish) to stay with a friend and her daughterâ€¦ and a hot shower. Nearby Saturday market in SommiÃ¨res is famous and one of the largest in the southeast. Walking through tiny streets full of fresh produce, clothes and antiques was cute, and on the return home we stopped at ChÃ¢teau Tornac â€“ origins dating back to the 11th century, and high up with spectacular views.

A youngster phoned introducing herself as the granddaughter of a neighbour. My heart dropped and I thought the worstâ€¦ anonymous texts continue to arrive complaining about the noise. The hesitant voice in English said her grandmother would like to invite me in for a drink â€“ with her children and grandchildren â€“ all living with her. The relief was so enormous my eyes welled up, while driving at 130km ðŸ¤©
