## Week 42
After a few slow weeks things have ramped up to top speed. Placed an order for three bathrooms – shower bases, toilet pedestals and a bathtub. Coming from up north near Paris, they’ll arrive two days before plasterboard sheets, metal track and timber arrive. Amazon haven’t missed out with deliveries most days including Saturday. After months of removing, I’m looking forward to adding. There was a noise in amongst some scrap timber I’d left standing in a corner – a neighbour’s hand was coming over and pinching it. I’ll wander over today and ask them in to take what they want… it may save me a trip to the dump.

I have stopped my DuoLingo subscription. After nearly three years of daily contact and competition with the app/game, it was a hard habit to kick. I logged in a few times to check my score, and I kept “earning” a free week. 🤩

On the application to renew my visa to stay, I have to agree to not convert people's religious or political beliefs; or enter into a polygamous relationship. Within Europe, France has the most people reporting no belief in any sort of spirit, god, or higher power.

Headed out and about through the week to Clermont, Lacoste and Villeneuvette – a few small historical villages not far up the road.

Villeneuvette – housing workers for a textile factory (looms for sheets and uniforms) created in 1673.

The factory lies derelict. Some housing remains with approximately 70 residents. They have to have internet don't they?

Lac du Salagou (Lake Salagou) – a detour that proved spectacular.

Lots of quaint streets in Lacoste.
