## Week 44
Had some fun time sharing a kayak paddline down the river H√©rault earlier this week‚Ä¶ 12kms and four hours including stopping along the way for lunch. Nothing hard as the flow was moving in our direction and some tiny rapids egged us on. It was a pleasant break in amongst a crazy hardware occurrence and building things in the shade as it‚Äôs now warm here. I returned some timber and the store wouldn‚Äôt put the money back onto a card, or give me cash‚Ä¶ they are posting out a cheque. I bought some pine lengths to make saw horses‚Ä¶ and at 70‚Ç¨ they convert to roughly $70 eachüòØ

Associations are celebrating end of year now, with things starting up again in October. The photography club held a lunch today at The Priory of Saint Michel de Grandmont (built 1128). Incredibly old and beautiful and a great lunch‚Ä¶ no aircon and 34¬∞ in the shade üòÅ. I never understood why people swapped countries during seasons‚Ä¶ obvious now! Reverse-cycling for the entire house has been quoted and accepted. I've temporarily lost today's photos... will download again and post next week.

Inexperienced people are always put at the front!

Stopped at Saint-Thib√©y on the way back from kayaking. Took photos of the Abbey which was beautiful, but think this one is more refreshing!
