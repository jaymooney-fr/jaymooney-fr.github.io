## Week 37
Iâ€™m a bit frustrated on the house frontâ€¦ need to order some big things like kitchens, bathrooms and a carport (all modular) but have no space to store them. Theyâ€™ll temporarily live on the covered patio once the builder gets his act together. Until then I continue ordering lots of small things just to keep Amazon solvent.

Iâ€™ve been out socialising a few times this week. Itâ€™s lovely being invited out for a walk or a coffee â€“ and Iâ€™m enjoying building up a community around me. Sometimes I take locals to places they havenâ€™t seen before which is hilarious. I keep offering my excel skills for no charge but nobodyâ€™s interested ðŸ¤£.

One of the walks revisited was the gorge at ColombiÃ¨res-sur-Orbâ€¦ very beautiful and very popular. So popular that a couple has established a pizzeria where we ate al fresco in the middle of wild nature.
