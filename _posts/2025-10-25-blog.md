## Y2 â€¢ Week 10
Two friends visiting Camargue (UNESCO recognised saline wetlands 1.5 hours north west) invited me to tag along. Playing tourists, we took a boat to see the sites including a staged showing of local horses and cattle. Camargue horses are born with dark hair which eventually turns white with their skin staying dark. The area has more than 400 species of birds including flamingos, and 40 species of mosquitoes â€“ some being the most ferocious found anywhere in France ðŸ˜¯

Bifold doors were also delivered this week ready for stage two whenever the builder shows up. Iâ€™ve worn out a hammer drill and two pairs of heavy-duty glovesâ€¦ so Amazon still showing record profits! A neighbour has helped take metal to a collection depot. We somehow got large beam offcuts (>2m long) into his van jammed in with a whole lot of other rusty bits and received 76â‚¬ which I just gave to him.

For some visas there is a French civic knowledge test â€“ multiple choice requiring 80% or higher to pass. I sat a dummy test and passedâ€¦ not sure Iâ€™d do the same in an equivalent Australian test. Some of the questions were â€“  
Q. Approx population of France? A. 68 million.  
Q. What are the three words of the French national motto? A. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.   
Q. The national day of France is celebrated on? A. July 14   
Q. During a crisis, a citizen volunteers at a food bank. Which republican value does this express most clearly? A. Fraternity.  
Q. How long is the presidential term in France? A. 5 years  
Q. The French Revolution began in? A. 1789  
Q. For what ages is schooling compulsory in France? A. 3 to 16 years old.
